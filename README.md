# FilterEventTickets

### Coding Exercise:
1. Create a json file that has 5-10 events with the following files (id, city, artiste, price)
2. Render the list of events showing the city, artist, and price for each event
3. Create a filter (using a textbox and a button) for the city field. Users should be able to enter just a part of the name and the result will be all the cities that have those characters.
4. Create another filter (using another text box but with the same button as above) for the price field. Price should be less than or equal to. 
5. Please note that users can filter using both (AND) filters or using one (OR) of the filters.
6. DO NOT BOTHER ABOUT STYLING
7. Endeavor to complete this task starting from task 2 within 45 minutes.

Note, very ugly UI
